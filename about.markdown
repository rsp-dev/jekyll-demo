This blog is using a modified Jekyll theme.

The theme is forked from [hyde][hyde] theme from [mdo][mdo] (which can be found on GitHub [here][hyde-gh]).

The fork of the theme is [here][hyde-fork], which
includes fixes such as allowing custom styles in the `<head>` 
and using the right [folder][hyde-fork-pr-1] for assets (courtesy of [glebius][hyde-fork-pr-1-original]).
